Hello.
I want to change the script of this online game. 
I have some ideas that I want to implement them. 
In fact new modules of a future game. 
I need someone to help me and to schedule new modules after my ideas. 
The game, 2Moons is a free open source script.
Besides the basic script I want to introduce more modules, change its design, to put another template, to integrate a chat like that on facebook, forums, both integrated and linked to the database, and menu, the administration of the game. 
I want to translate the game in as many languages. Each module it is negotiated / auctioned separately.
The budget is $ 5-30 for each module depending on complexity.

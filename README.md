Hello.
I want to change the script of this online game. 
I have some ideas that I want to implement them. 
In fact new modules of a future game. 
I need someone to help me and to schedule new modules after my ideas. 
The game, 2Moons is a free open source script.
Besides the basic script I want to introduce more modules, change its design, to put another template, to integrate a chat like that on facebook, forums, both integrated and linked to the database, and menu, the administration of the game. 
I want to translate the game in as many languages. Each module it is negotiated / auctioned separately.
The budget is $ 5-30 for each module depending on complexity.

What changes they want for this site:


1. Dark matter be virtual currency of the game. All purchases or sales expenses payments to be made with this game currency. It can be bought with real money. In the game there are now paypal. Any other payment processor is welcome.
2. Implementing a chat like facebook. The chat must be implemented in the script to use the data from the database. Username avatar, aliance. It must also created rooms depending on the alliance, according to friends, the general room. etc. depending on various demands of the game  |http://codologic.com/page/freichat-free-php-chat-script-software |
3. Implementation of a forum. The Forum must be implemented in the script to use the data from the database. Username rank etc. I love this forum if it can be implemented http://codoforum.com/
4. I want to implement a system of referrals, with separate page, and banners referrals game has a banner and link somewhere but not visible. I want a separate module at referrals where they can be organized competitions, bonuses, lists, statistics .... Market of referals but with some restrictions because only active referrals can be sold only after a certain number of days / activity / level. 10% tax to shareholders. Conection the admin menu for various settings.

Each holder of shares it receives the share value. It must also set up a stock market
7. Translations. Game must be translated into as many languages. Basic language be English. all translations will be done after the module in English. As each new module, engage, and perform translations, they will be made only after the implementation, all modules

The price can be set in either the amount x admin and the construction / technology or the amount x number of ships to be made. All amounts go in module shareholding. Conection the admin menu for various settings.
